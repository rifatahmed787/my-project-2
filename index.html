		   <h3>Life is beautiful with friend</h3>
		   <p>Friendship means mutual understanding between two intimate persons. Man is a social being. He can not live alone. He wants a companion. He can not do even a single day without the help of others. He depends on others.He needs other's help. This dependence results in friendship. Friendship is a social virtue. It is a great blessing in life. A good friend is better than reputation and wealth. A true friend always stands by his friend in weal and woe. He does not play false with his friend.A famous philosopher Euripides said, “Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness.”</p>
